# QML Interface Builder

Infrastructure to build a QML/Qt CPP interface based on an interface definition 
language and templates.

This tool set is not build for highest performance. Rather flexibility in the 
IDL design and generator creation was the goal. It uses great libraries to 
minimize the amount of code required to be maintained.

The code parsing and generation part a very flexible and allows many users to
generate their vision of a QMLCPP interface. 

The Domain language is surely not limited to this.

Please see the INSTALL and USAGE guides for more information.
