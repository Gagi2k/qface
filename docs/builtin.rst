Builtin Generators
==================

QFace contains several built in code generators. Their purpose is merely to showcase how to write a code generator
with QFace. They are working and complete examples of a general purpose generators.

* The QtCPP generator generates a Qt C++ plugin with a QML API ready to be used in your project.
* The QtQml generator generates a QML only API which ready to be used.

From the QML user interface perspective both provide the same API and are interchangeable.
